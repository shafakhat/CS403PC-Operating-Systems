# CS403PC-Operating-Systems

# Description:
This course introduces key operating system concepts such as processes, threads, scheduling, synchronization, memory management, and file I/O subsystems. It covers Unix commands and system calls for process management, interprocess communication, and I/O. Students will gain hands-on experience in managing and interacting with Unix systems.
# Prerequisites:
1. A course on “Computer Programming and Data Structures”.
2. A course on “Computer Organization and Architecture”.
   
# Course Objectives:
● Introduce operating system concepts (i.e., processes, threads, scheduling, synchronization,deadlocks, memory management, file and I/O subsystems andprotection)
● Introduce the issues to be considered in the design and development of operating system
● Introduce basic Unix commands, system call interface for process management,interprocesscommunication and I/O in Unix

# Course Outcomes:
● Will be able to control access to a computer and the files that may be shared
● Demonstrate the knowledge of the components of computers and their respectiveroles incomputing.
● Ability to recognize and resolve user problems with standard operating environments.
● Gain practical knowledge of how programming languages, operating systems,andarchitectures interact and how to use each effectively.
